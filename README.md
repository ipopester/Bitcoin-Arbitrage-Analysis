# Bitcoin Exchange Arbitrage Analysis

This is analysis of the trends and patterns of the price of Bitcoin listed on two cryptocurrency exchanges, Bitstamp and Coinbase, from January through March, 2018. Three days were selected from this time period to evaluate arbitrage opportunities. A threshold of 1% profit was used to determine the threshold for trading opportunities in order to cover trading fees.

## Technologies

The analysis was performed using python 3.7 and is designed to be executed through a CLI (command line interface), such as Terminal (MacOS) or GitBash (Windows). Below are the critical dependencies used and associated documentation:

* [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.7.11 

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) 1.10.0

* [jupyter](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 0.4.0
